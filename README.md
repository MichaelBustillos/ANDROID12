#	Gimme yo' money
### App Description
An app that builds off of the current online payment system used by apps like Venmo, and elevates it by allowing users to have the option to "group pay" a charge by splitting it however they choose and directly charging it from their accounts hassle-free. The one unique characteristic of this app is that you can connect with retailers, restaurants, etc. to make payments too where group paying is typically seen.

### App Idea Evaluation
// TODO: Evaluate app across the following categories using the App Evaluation Protocol.

- Mobile: A person won't be making payments while in public on a computer.
- Story: Stores the card information of the users and then collaborates each of their accounts (like a group) and calculates the amount owed to the retailer and splits it between them and pays it directly.
- Market: The scope of this market has the potential to be huge as anyone who has a debit/credit card can use this. This app aims at convenience of making payments anywhere when you are with a group getting dinner or even as simple as transfering money to someone.
- Habit: The use of this app depends on the frequency the uesr goes out to eat with a group of people.
- Scope: This app is most likely to hard for us to finish by the end of the course, however we have a solid foundation conceptually for what we want the app to look like. Granted, it's very new, so we are still thinking of all the small details.
